######  favorite vacation spot is Rajasthan 


Rajasthan, **located in northwest India** it is the countryâ€™s largest state. Featuring a unique mixture of historical marvels and cultural treasures, it is known as the **Land of Kings**. Known for the undulating sand dunes of the Thar Desert and its vibrant colors, this royal state is a must-see.

Rajasthan has a lot of ancient forts and palaces, thus giving it the name, **"royal state of India"**.

My most favourite cities in rajasthan are

**Jaisalmer**

**Jaipur**

**Jodhpur**
