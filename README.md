### Code Fencing: CSS Code for S Number ending with 1.



>I've got a tabbed navigation bar where I'd like the open tab to have a shadow to set it apart from the other tabs. I'd also like the whole tab section to have a single shadow (see bottom horizontal line) going up, shading the bottom of all tabs except for the open one.I'm going to use CSS3's box-shadow property to do it, but I can't figure out a way to shade only the parts I want.
Normally I'd cover up the bottom shadow of the open tab with the content area (higher z-index), but in this case the content area itself has a shadow so that would just wind up covering the tab.
